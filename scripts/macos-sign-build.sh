#!/usr/bin/env sh
# Build a macOS bundle that is signed with a Developer ID Application
# certificate and notarized by Apple.
#
# Credentials come from `.env.signing` (git-ignored; see `.env.signing.example`).
# With them exported, `pnpm tauri build` signs the .app with hardened runtime,
# submits it to Apple's notary service, and staples the ticket. Extra arguments
# are forwarded to the build, e.g.
#     ./scripts/macos-sign-build.sh --target universal-apple-darwin
# The build runs from the repository root (see below), so a relative path inside
# those arguments resolves against the root, not against the caller's directory.
#
# Tauri does NOT notarize the .dmg that wraps the .app: the CLI drives
# bundle_dmg.sh, that script takes a --notarize option, and the CLI's argument
# list does not pass it (read out of the shipped cli.darwin-arm64.node in
# @tauri-apps/cli 2.11.4). An un-notarized disk image is what a user downloads,
# so this script notarizes and staples each produced .dmg afterwards.
#
# Without `.env.signing` this script refuses to run — signing is its whole
# purpose. The plain `pnpm tauri build` remains the unsigned path and needs
# none of these values.
