#!/usr/bin/env sh
# Register the GitHub Actions secrets a macOS runner needs to sign and notarize
# the build. The Apple account values (APPLE_ID / APPLE_PASSWORD /
# APPLE_TEAM_ID) are read from `.env.signing`; the certificate comes from a
# password-protected .p12 exported from Keychain Access, and
# APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY is derived from that .p12's certificate common name.
#
# Deriving the identity from the .p12 rather than copying `.env.signing`'s
# APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY is deliberate: local signing accepts a SHA-1 hash as
# the identity, but a CI runner imports the certificate and string-matches its
# common name against APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY — a hash there fails the build.
#
# No secret value is printed: each is piped straight into `gh secret set`.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/setup-ci-signing-secrets.sh path/to/DeveloperID.p12
#
# Export the certificate first: Keychain Access > login > My Certificates >
# "Developer ID Application: <Name> (<TEAMID>)" > right-click > Export…, save as
# a .p12 and set an export password (you type it below).
#
# Prerequisites: `gh` authenticated for this repository and a filled-in
# `.env.signing` (see `.env.signing.example`).
