# AGENTS.md

Execution rules for agents (e.g. Codex) working in this repository. `AGENTS.ja.md`
is the Japanese counterpart of the same rules. If the two ever disagree, do not
start implementing — resolve the contradiction first.

## Project model

- Atlas handles multiple registered project roots and Backlog roots. Do not
  aggregate every project's tasks into one central Backlog.
- The source of truth for each project's tasks stays in that project's Backlog
  root.

## Updates

- Delegate updates to Backlog tasks, documents, and milestones to Backlog CLI
  calls that run with the target project as their working directory. Do not edit
  the managed Markdown files directly.
- Run Backlog CLI and Git with fixed subcommands and argument arrays. Never
  concatenate user input into a shell string and execute it.

## Identifiers

- On the cross-project screen, use `<project-slug>:<TASK-ID>`. Within a project's
  commits and Pull Requests, use `TASK-N`.

## Git and Pull Request references

- Search Git history for a task ID in the repository of the project that owns the
  task.
- Read Pull Request URLs from a task's References. Where the remote supports it,
  resolve the relationship between commits and Pull Requests.

## Dependencies

- Before adding any new production dependency — Tauri/Wails, a UI library, a
  Markdown/frontmatter parser, bundling the Backlog CLI, and so on — confirm the
  selection rationale and the scope of its introduction.

## Working conventions

- Code comments in English; user-facing explanations in Japanese by default.
- After implementation, run the relevant tests, formatter, and static analysis.
  Report anything that cannot be run, with the reason.
- Do not commit, rewrite history, or push to a remote without an explicit request.
